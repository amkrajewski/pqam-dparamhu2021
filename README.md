PyQAlloy-compatible Model for D Parameter Prediction Based on Yong-Jie Hu 2021 (10.1016/j.actamat.2021.116800)



## Hu's README File

Hello, thank you for your interest in our work!
Here we provide a script written in R language to take an alloy composition of interest and correspondingly predict the GSF energy, surface energy, and the ductility parameter based on the SL models in our manuscript ( https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2021.116800)
To run the script and make predictions, you need to:
1)	Download the RStudio platform. (https://www.rstudio.com/) ## No worry, it is open access üòä
2)	Put all the files you downloaded from Materials Commons (basically all our files) into one local folder
3)	Open the ‚Äúpredict.R‚Äù file in RStudio, input the alloy composition there, execute every line there, and the prediction will jump out in the console window below. 

Please contact qiliang@umich.edu or yh593@drexel.edu if you have any questions. 

P.S.,
‚Äúpredict_screen_4nary_all.csv‚Äù is the original data for plotting Figure 7&8 in the manuscript. Other figures in the manuscript can be reproduced by the data listed in the tables in the manuscript.
